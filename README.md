- **Goal Detail Page**
  - Title of the main goal
  - Description and motivation for the goal
  - Progress tracker (percentage completed)
  - List of sub-goals with completion status
  - Button to add new sub-goal
  - Button to view resources or tips related to the goal

- **Sub-Goal Detail Page**
  - Title of the sub-goal
  - Description and steps needed
  - List of tasks associated with the sub-goal
  - Progress tracker for the sub-goal
  - Button to add a new task
  - Notes section for user reflections

- **Task Page**
  - Title of the task
  - Description and due date
  - Option to mark as completed
  - Option to edit or delete the task

#### 2. **Navigation**
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**
  - Home
  - Goals (Main Goals List)
  - Profile (User settings and statistics)
  - Resources (Articles, videos, or motivational quotes)

#### 3. **User Onboarding**
- **Welcome Screens**
  - Introduction to the app’s features
  - Guided setup to choose main goals
  - Option to set initial sub-goals

- **Goal Setting Wizard**
  - Step-by-step guide for setting main goals
  - Templates or prompts for sub-goals and tasks

#### 4. **Features**
- **Progress Tracking**
  - Visual graphs showing progress over time
  - Notifications/reminders for upcoming tasks or check-ins

- **Community Support**
  - Option to join or create groups for accountability
  - Share achievements on social media

- **Customization**
  - Themes and colors
  - Option to set personal reminders for each goal

- **Resources Section**
  - Curated content related to each goal category
  - Inspirational quotes or success stories

#### 5. **Backend Structure**
- **User Profiles**
  - Store user preferences and progress
  - Sync data across devices

- **Database for Goals**
  - Main goals, sub-goals, and tasks
  - User-generated content and community interactions

- **Analytics Dashboard**
  - For tracking user engagement and progress
  - Collect feedback for continuous improvement

### Example User Flow

1. **User opens the app.**
2. **Home Screen displays all main goals with progress bars.**
3. **User selects “Spiritual” goal.**
4. **Goal Detail Page shows progress, sub-goals, and an option to add a new sub-goal.**
5. **User adds a sub-goal: “Meditate daily.”**
6. **User sets tasks for the sub-goal: “Download meditation app,” “Choose a time.”**
7. **User receives reminders and tracks progress.**
8. **User checks in with the community for motivation.**

### Design Considerations
- **User-Centric Design:** Ensure the app is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Accessibility:** Use readable fonts, color contrasts, and include alternative text for images.
- **Engagement:** Incorporate gamification elements (badges for completing goals, streaks for daily tasks) to encourage user interaction.

This blueprint should give you a solid foundation to start developing your app. Feel free to adapt and expand upon these ideas based on user feedback and testing!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Creating an app that helps users set and track goals across different categories is a fantastic idea! Here’s a blueprint for your app design, breaking it down into key components and user flow:
